<h1>Creating a Web Page - Notes from Session 1</h1>

<h2>1. The Difference between HTML and CSS</h2>
</div>
<div>
<p>
<b>The House Analogy</b>
</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
HTML is the structure and CSS is the Style. Visualize a house - HTML represents the rooms and CSS represents the design elements, like carpeting or the colors of the walls for example. 
</p>
</div>
<div>
  <h2>2. Think Inside the Box</h2>
When working on a new design, think in terms of boxes.  Everything on a website is really a box. <br>
Even a circle is <em>really</em> a <b>box!</b>
</div>
<div>
 <h2>3. The Importance of Structure</h2>
As stated above, it's very helpful to think of a webpage as a set of boxes. Oftentimes boxes inside of boxes. This "family tree" structure allows the programmer to breakdown a design and compartamentalize it so it become easier to program.
</div>
<div>
<h2>4. Repetition is bad, bad, bad!</h2>
Repetition can lead to errors when there becomes so much repetitive code that the programmer is likely to make mistakes when making changes. Avoiding repetition by defining classes also allows the programmer to easily establish consistency and make changes versus having to manually make lots of updates.

<h2>5. Using different Code Editors</h2>
</div>
<div>
<p>
<b>1. Scratchpad</b>
</p>
<p>
Scratchpad is great for beginners. Feedback is immediate. Can't share your work though.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
<b>2. Codepen</b>
</p>
<p>
Codepen has less beginner friendly features but allows all three languages, HTML, CSS, and Java.  Codepen is also great for sharing - just need an account.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
<b>3. Sublime</b>
</p>
<p>
Sublime is more difficult to learn but is more robust than Scratchpad or Codepen. It will be the main tool we use as our skills progress.
